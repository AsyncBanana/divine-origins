# Divine Origins

Divine Origins currently adds four origins, Devil, Demigod, Jötunn, and Minotaur. I will add more soon.

## Devil

Devil is PVP-focused, with natural armor and faster attack speed for all weapons. However, they burn in sunlight and spawn in the Nether.

## Demigod

Demigod has a lesser effect on your playstyle than Devil and is more well-rounded. You get things like a speed buff and immunity to many harmful status effects like Wither and Poison and better passive regen but at the cost of decreased health and damage.

## Jötunn

Jötunn is a bit of a tank origin, inspired by the Norse frost giants. They have natural armor and strong arms but also have slight slowness and more exhaustion. However, their primary ability is inflicting slowness and cold upon hitting entities as if you went into powder snow.
